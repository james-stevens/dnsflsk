# dnsflsk
This is an HTTPS/JSON <-> DNS proxy following the [Google JSON/DNS/API](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh/json),
using `Flask` and `dnspython` to do the heavy lifting.

I'm using ...

* Python - v3.6.9
* dnspython - v1.16.0
* Flask - v1.1.1

It's mostly just for fun, but if you find it useful - cool.
If you feel like it, leave a comment in the [first issue](https://github.com/james-stevens/dnsflsk/issues/1) called `Just for chatting`


# Work-in-progress

Currently this is massively a work-in-progress, so the `master` branch will change (probably daily),
but I will try and keep it stable -i.e. it works.
